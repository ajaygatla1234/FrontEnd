    <p>Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O. It is a transparent, tasteless,
        odorless, and
        nearly colorless chemical substance, and it is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all
        known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent<sup>[20]</sup>). It is vital for all known forms of life,
        despite not
        providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula. H<sub>2</sub>O, indicates that each of
        its molecules
        contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the
        oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45<sup>o</sup> "Water" is also the name of the liquid state of H<sub>2</sub>O at
        standard temperature
        and pressure.</p>
